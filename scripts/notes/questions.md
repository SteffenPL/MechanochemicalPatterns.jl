How large is gravity on this scale.

Is the early limb formation shown in the FW_Day1 data a consequence of "liquid"-"aggregate" interaction. E.g. does the push from the magenta cells induce enough force to push the aggregate in one direction.

What exactly are the colours and enviroment conditions for the micromass experiment?
