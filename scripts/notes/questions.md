- How large is gravity on this scale.

Gravity consant: 9.81 m/s^2 = 0.76 μm/hr^2 
Mass of a cell: 10 pg 
Gravity force: F/m = 0.076 μm/hr^2


- Is the early limb formation shown in the FW_Day1 data a consequence of "liquid"-"aggregate" interaction. E.g. does the push from the magenta cells induce enough force to push the aggregate in one direction.

- What exactly are the colours and enviroment conditions for the micromass experiment?
